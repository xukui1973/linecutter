# linecutter
This is a python funtion to detect a cutter to a line when people queueing at school. It uses the opencv library to detect people's face, mark a square around it and tracking the face movement and find the overtaking of one face to another. It would be useful to find a cutter and help the cutter to realize this is not right.

This is a 8th grader science project which is during the students were at Joaquin Moraga Intermediate School.
